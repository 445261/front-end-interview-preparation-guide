The goal of this guide is to help you prepare and practice for your next interview. We have curated this list of resources to keep it manageable and as impactful as possible. The learning resources are mostly focused around JavaScript, but the practice questions cover the entire Frontend spectrum.

- [1. Learn](#learn)
- [2. Practice](#practice)

# Learn
These resources are the ideal to brush up on Frontend related topics. Before diving into practice questions it's best to review or learn Frontend specific material.

#### JavaScript
<a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Don't Know JS</a>  
You Don't Know JS is arguablly the single best resource for really learning JavaScript and how it works under the hood. Of all the resources here we recommemnd .

<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a>  

<a href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/">JavaScript Design patterns</a>  
Even though this book is higher level than the previous two, it's worth reading. After reviewing the previous low level books applying that to design patterns should bring everything together.

#### JavaScript (ES6 focused)
<a href="https://www.nczonline.net/blog/tag/ecmascript-6/">Ecmascript 6</a>  

<a href="https://github.com/ericdouglas/ES6-Learning">Learn Ecamscript 6 interactively</a>  

#### Data Strcutrues
<a href="https://github.com/thejameskyle/itsy-bitsy-data-structures">Itsy Bitsy Data Structures</a>  
If you're already very familiar with data structures it's worth skipping this. *Depending on the type of Frontend job you're looking for Itsy Bitsy Data Structures may not be completely relevant -- although, it will strengthen any developers approach to programming.*

# Practice
This is where it all comes together. Go through as many practice problems as you can. There's no secret to it other than time, effort, and repitition. If you don't know an answer spend extra time understanding it.

#### Practice questions
<a href="https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions">Frontend Job Interview Questions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/utatti/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions-And-Answers/tree/master/answers">answers</a>  

<a href="https://github.com/khan4019/front-end-Interview-Questions">Frontend Job Interview Questions, including algorithms</a> 

<a href="https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions">Toptal JavaScript interview questions</a>  

<a href="http://www.thatjsdude.com/interview/">That JS Dude</a> 

#### Frontend Quizzes
<a href="http://davidshariff.com/quiz/">David Shariff quiz</a>  
The Front End Web Development Quiz from David Shariff is more fun than realistic. A lot of the questions are specific nuggets of information that are generally not asked in real interviews. Go through this one and have some fun, but don't be too worried about your score.

<a href="https://triplebyte.com/users/start">Triplebyte interview</a>  

*TripleByte* online quiz should only be done if you are serious about applying to a company they partner with. Their Frontend interview process if _real_ and can lead to a potential job offer.

#### Glassdoor Questions
These questions are meant to reflect real interview questions you would get from interviewing at Facebook or Airbnb. Try your best to solve the questions without looking up answers. Break the problem down into small pieces and start solving from there.
